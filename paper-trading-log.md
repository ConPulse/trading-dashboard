## Week 1: Feb 23–28, 2026

### Wednesday Feb 25 — IGV ENTRY (Day 3)
**Trade:** IGV (iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF)
**Thesis:** SaaSpocalypse overreaction bounce — software sector dropped 32%, RSI hit 18 (most oversold since 1990)
**Entry:** $78.41
**Shares:** 31 ($2,430.71 position — ~24% of capital)
**Stop Loss:** $75.50 (-$90.21 / -3.7%)
**Target:** $92.00 (+$421.39 / +17.3%)
**R:R:** 4.7:1
**Conviction:** 8/10

### Monday Feb 23 — NO TRADES (Day 1)
**Reason:** Weekend tariff escalation (Trump 15% global tariffs after SCOTUS struck IEEPA). Risk-off across all assets. BTC crashed -4.7% to $64.2K (broke $67.5K support thesis). S&P futures -0.3%. Not forcing entries into chaos.

**Watchlist reviewed:**
| Ticker | Thesis | Conviction | Decision | Reason |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| NVDA | Earnings Wed Feb 25 | 6/10 | NO ENTRY | Don't front-run earnings in risk-off tape |
| SPY | Trend toward 7,000 | 4/10 | NO ENTRY | Tariff uncertainty killed momentum |
| BTC | Long $67.5K support | 2/10 | NO ENTRY | Support broke — crashed to $64.2K |
| XLI | Industrials rotation | 5/10 | NO ENTRY | Tariffs = headwind for industrials |
| CRWV | Bounce candidate | 3/10 | WATCH ONLY | Still falling, no reversal signal |

**Day 1 Lesson:** Best trade is no trade when conditions don't meet the rules. Discipline > activity.

### Wednesday Feb 25 — FIRST TRADE (Day 3)

**Trade #1: IGV (Software ETF) — LONG @ $78.41**
- **Thesis:** "SaaSpocalypse" overreaction bounce. Software sector lost $2T in market cap. IGV dropped 32%, RSI hit 18 (most oversold since 1990), now recovering to 30.5. Panic selling exhausted. AI needs software — the "AI replaces software" narrative is logically broken.
- **Human nature edge:** Retail dumped everything when JPMorgan/Jefferies coined panic names. Pain threshold selling (15-20% drawdown) creates forced sellers. We're buying their capitulation.
- **Technical:** RSI 30.5 (oversold line), bouncing. +1.9% today = early recovery signal.
- **Catalyst:** NVDA earnings tonight — if AI spending is confirmed strong, software rebounds because AI RUNS on software.
- **Entry:** PENDING — buy at open if price is $77.50-$79.50. If gaps above $79.50, skip.
- **Stop:** $73.00 (previous low) → Risk: -$173 (1.7% of portfolio)
- **Target:** $92.00 (50-day MA) → Reward: +$435 (4.4% of portfolio)
- **R:R:** 2.5:1
- **Conviction:** 8/10 (Technical ✓ Macro ✓ Human nature ✓ Catalyst ✓)

**Also watching:**
- AMD ($213.84, +8.8%) — Will enter ONLY if NVDA beats earnings tonight
- MSTR ($124.61, RSI 41) — Will enter ONLY if BTC breaks $67K
